The `rdnv` repository is the one-stop shop container for research, design and verification tasks in
the Computer Architecture and Digital Design domains. It contains reusable modules, utilities,
design examples and more for your research or design tasks.

Full documentation is available through `Read the Docs`.

The repository is organized in modules

around the `organa` framework consisting of: pre-verified design blocks
and simulation scripts. The pre-verified design blocks are to be found in the `tatooine` market.
Their documentation is instead located beneath the `dooku` documentation system.

## Contents

- `LICENCE`, licence agreement file;
- `setenv.sourceme`, top-level setup script;
- `README.md`, this file;
- `tatooine/`, the library of reusable design modules and their simulation scripts;
- `dooku/`, the documentation system of the `tatooine` library;
- `extra/`, utilities, external documentation and anything that does not belong to the previous
  folders.
