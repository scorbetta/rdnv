The [`rdnv`](https://github.com/scorbetta/rdnv) repository is the one-stop shop of reusable
resources for your research, design and verification tasks in the digital electronics domain.

The repository is organized in *sections*. Each section is reserved to a specific type of resources,
documented in this mini-site. Readers, please use the menu on the top to navigate.

`tatooine`

The RTL library of verified components. Synthesis-ready and simulation-only modules are present.

`organa`

The verification environment for the `tatooine` library. The verification environment is based on
[`cocotb`](https://www.cocotb.org/) and tools from [`YosysHQ`](https://github.com/YosysHQ).

`dooku`

The documentation system. This section includes the source code, script and additional files to
generate this mini-site. It also contains documentation for the
[`grogu`](https://github.com/scorbetta/grogu) engine.

`dagobah`

A collection of utilities.

`the_order`

A set of rules to deliver high-quality RTL designs and readable source code.

## Disclaimer
The author puts his best effort in delivering pre-verified resources; for instance, most of the RTL
modules are either FPGA or ASIC proven.  However, this is a continuous work-in-progress, so any
comment, request or criticism can be easily addressed to the author himself.
